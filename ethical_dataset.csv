0;law case;"The applicant was a Romanian NGO known as the Association for the Defence of Human Rights in Romania-Helsinki Committee (“Association”), representing a deceased party, Ionel Garcea.  Garcea was a mentally ill prisoner who died in prison. During his sentence, he made a number of complaints about his treatment, with the Association representing him. In June 2007, Garcea attempted suicide and underwent an operation as a result. Less than a month later, Garcea died in the prison hospital.

Following his death, the Association filed an administrative complaint with the prison, asking for an investigation into his medical treatment and cause of death. The Association also sent a report about Garcea’s death to the prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor had ordered a forensic medical report, which stated that there was not enough evidence to suggest that medical assistance was inadequate. The prosecutor declined to pursue further investigation.

The Association appealed the prosecutor’s decision several times arguing that Garcea had not received appropriate treatment and that there had not been an effective investigation.

In 2011, the Bucharest Court of Appeal ordered that the investigation into the circumstances around Garcea’s death continue, as it had not been thorough. At the time of trial, the investigation into his death was still pending.

The Association argued that Garcea’s medical treatment, general treatment during detention, and the investigation conducted into his detention violated Article 2 (right to life), Article 3 (prohibition of torture), and Article 13 (right to an effective remedy) of the European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“Convention”).";/;"The Court held that there had been a violation of the procedural limb of Article 2.  The Court agreed with the Association’s argument that the authorities failed to comply with their obligation to effectively investigate Garcea’s death.  In particular, the Court noted that the investigations had been pending for more than seven years.  Additionally, the Court noted that a joint committee between the Ministries of Justice and Health was not established, which was required under Joint Order no. 995/2007 when a death occurred in prison.

The Court held that there had been no violation of the substantive limb of Article 2. The Court stated that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of medical negligence resulting in Garcea’s death, as the investigation was still ongoing.

The Court held that there was no reason to give separate rulings on Articles 3 and 13.

As for procedural issues, the Court held that the Association had standing to represent Garcea. The Court referred to a recent judgment in which the Court held that an association may represent a victim in the absence of power of attorney, and notwithstanding that the victim died before an application was submitted, when the circumstances are exceptional and the allegations serious. With respect to Garcea’s circumstances, the Court noted that he died in State custody with no known relatives and suffered from mental illness. The Court also relied on the seriousness of the allegations under the Convention Articles. Finally, the Court considered the fact that the Association had represented him several times during his incarceration to be relevant.";/;"“In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivation of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Where the authorities decide to place and maintain in detention a person with disabilities, they should demonstrate special care in guaranteeing such conditions as correspond to his special needs resulting from his disability.” Para. 66.

“The State’s duty to safeguard the right to life must be considered to involve not only the taking of reasonable measures to ensure the safety of individuals in public places but also, in the event of serious injury or death, having in place an effective independent judicial system securing the availability of legal means capable of promptly establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim.” Para. 67.";Global health and Human Rights Database 
1;law case;"The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (“Commission”) brought an application alleging that the rights of women in Northern Ireland who are or become pregnant with a serious malformation of the fetus (SMF), fatal fetal abnormality (FFA) or who are pregnant as a result of sexual crimes were being breached by Section 58 and Section 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (1861 Act) and Section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act (1945 Act). Sections 58 and 59 stipulated criminal sanctions and fines for procuring drugs and using instruments to cause an abortion. Section 25 ordered life imprisonment for the destruction of a child capable of being born alive.

The Commission sought a declaration that these laws breached Article 3 (prohibition on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment), Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life), and Article 14 (prohibition on discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights (“Convention”).";/;"The Court held that the provisions breached Article 8 of the Convention only by the absence of exceptions to the general prohibition on abortions in the cases of FFAs and pregnancies resulting from sexual crimes, up to the date when the fetus becomes capable of existing independently of the mother. In the case of FFAs, the court held that there is no human life to protect and it is not proportionate to refuse to provide an exception to criminal sanctions. Sexual crimes violate the personal autonomy of a woman. Consequently, the court held that the provisions prohibited abortion for innocent victims in a way that ignores their circumstances. In the case of SMF, the Court held that, given the possibility that a child with an SMF may be born and enjoy life, the failure to provide an exception for SMFs under the impugned provisions was proportionate.

The Court added that when a fetus becomes capable of existing independently of the mother, it is in  counter-balance with the rights of the mother. In those circumstances, the prohibition of abortion under the 1945 Act is not disproportionate.

The Court further held that the legislation did not breach Article 3 of the Convention, which provides absolute protection against inhuman and/or degrading treatment. Article 3 imposes a negative obligation on a state preventing it from inflicting ill-treatment and a positive obligation to take appropriate measures to prevent individuals from suffering ill-treatment at the hands of third parties. In the case of SMA, FFA or sexual crime, the Court observed that the status of the pregnancy was not of the State’s doing. Moreover, the State did not prevent pregnant women from traveling to England for abortions.

Because the Court found a breach under Article 8 – a substantive article – it did not consider the Article 14 claim.";/;"“Mindful that the State's obligations under Article 3 are primarily negative, and that we are dealing solely with the additional stress of pregnant women having to travel to England for an abortion, there is no convincing evidence before me that there are victims or potential victims within any of the three categories, which are the subject of this application, who are able to satisfy the minimum threshold of severity necessary to allow a Court to conclude that there has been a breach of their Article 3 rights. The ‘thin end of the wedge’ or ‘slippery slope’ argument also cannot be ignored. There is no reason to dismiss the possibility that a young woman who has become pregnant as the result of a consensual relationship due to an error on her part or a contraceptive malfunction, might also suffer a similar amount of additional stress of having to travel far from her family incurring substantial expenses in order to have her pregnancy terminated in England. It all depends on the psychological make-up and personal circumstances of the woman concerned.” Para. 121.

“As discussed, a normal foetus does not have an Article 2 right to life, although it does have some statutory protections. But in the case of an FFA, there is no life to protect. When the foetus leaves the womb, it cannot survive independently. It is doomed. There is nothing to weigh in the balance. There is no human life to protect. Furthermore, no evidence has been put before the court that a substantial section of Northern Ireland's community, never mind a majority, requires a mother to carry such a foetus to full term. Therefore, even on a light touch review, it can be said with a considerable degree of confidence that it is not proportionate to refuse to provide an exception to the criminal sanctions imposed by the impugned provisions in this particular case.” Para. 160.

“Further, there can be no doubt as I have observed that the current law places a disproportionate burden on the victim of sexual crime. She has to face all the dangers and problems, emotional or otherwise, of carrying a foetus for which she bears no moral responsibility but is merely a receptacle to carry the child of a rapist and/or a person who has committed incest, or both. For many weeks after the unlawful impregnation the foetus remains incapable of an existence outside the mother's womb. The law makes no attempt in those particular circumstances to balance the rights of the woman. In doing so, the law is enforcing the prohibition of abortion against an innocent victim of a crime in a way which completely ignores the personal circumstances of the victim. Weighed in the balance is the foetus, incapable of an independent existence for many weeks into the pregnancy. By imposing a blanket ban on abortion, reinforced with criminal sanctions, it effectively prevents any consideration of the interests of any woman whose personal autonomy in those circumstances has been so vilely and heinously invaded. A law so framed, can never be said to be proportionate.” Para. 162.";Global health and Human Rights Database 
2;law case;"The applicant was a Moldovan national. He was taken to a psychiatrist hospital from his house on 25 February 2008 by police officers. In the hospital, he was placed with patients with serious mental disorders, he wasn’t given the chance to contact his lawyer or his family despite his repeated requests, and injections had been administered to him as a result of which he had lost consciousness. The applicant was forced to take medication, and his medical records showed that he was treated against paranoid depression. There was also a consent form allegedly signed by him (he later stated to court that he hadn’t signed it). On letters dated 27 July and 26 December 2008, the District Court responded to the applicant’s explanation request stating that it had not received an official request for his forced hospitalization. Official records showed that the applicant hadn’t been registered as suffering from mental illness before 25 February 2008. Medical records signed on 13 June 2008 also confirmed that he wasn’t addicted to drugs or alcohol and didn’t have mental disorder either. 

On 29 August 2008, the applicant lodged his complaint to the Prosecutor’s office requesting for an opening of investigation on his forced illegal hospitalization and psychiatric treatment. He claimed that the medical information entered about him was not correct, and the Doctor who recorded his condition hadn’t seen him at all. The applicant claimed that  he was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the time he was hospitalized.

During the investigation process, it was found that the applicant was hospitalized because his family had approached the Doctor for a help to have the applicant hospitalized, claiming that they had been threatened by the his behavior. The Doctor stated that the applicant was brought to him for a consultation by a police office after which he had determined that the applicant had delusional belief which pose a risk to his family and thus justified his hospitalization.The Doctor also stated that he later issued a document stating that he was mentally healthy after the applicant explained to him that he had no such problems or treatments before.

The prosecution’s office requested the applicant to undergo psychiatric treatment to enable it determine his mental health status but the applicant refused as it would subject him to an in-patient treatment of 3 weeks. On 12 June 2009, the Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the applicant’s complaint on the ground that his previous hospitalization had been duly ordered by the Doctor and it was not able to make a determination on the diagnosis due to the applicant’s refusal of hospitalization. The issue of the consent form had not been argued on any occasion. His appeal to the superior Prosecutor’s Office was dismissed on 13 July 2009.

The applicant appealed before the District Court stating that the Doctor had confirmed his mental health as healthy, there was no court order for his hospitalization which made it unlawful and arbitrary. The court had dismissed the appeal on the ground that the applicant refused hospitalization. The matter was brought before the government and investigation was opened by the General Prosecutor’s Office. This investigation was pending when the applicant brought his claim to the European Court of Human Rights (the ECHR) and there hadn’t been a significant progress by the time the ECHR reviewed the case.

The applicant claimed that he had been arbitrarily detained in a psychiatric hospital in violation of Article 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). He also claimed that he had unlawfully been subjected to psychiatric treatment when he actually was healthy, that this had caused him a serious suffering and that this had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.";/;"The ECHR noted that the procedures for a compulsory hospitalization of a person as provided under domestic law had been disregarded in the applicant's case. It had also confirmed that there had not been any expert opinion regarding the applicant's state of mental health and the need to have had him hospitalized. The ECHR was not convinced by the argument of the government that the applicant was of unsound mind which required him to be hospitalized under domestic law. The government also failed to show that the applicant's mental health conditions (before his hospitalization) were of the kind and the degree to warrant his forced confinement.  The ECHR found a violation of Article 5 (1) of the Convention.

The ECHR noted that the applicant had been detained in the hospital for 41 days with no contact to the outside. Thus, the ECHR found that when he was subjected to an unlawful and arbitrary psychiatric treatment, the applicant could have reasonably felt feel fear, anguish and inferiority which constituted a degrading treatment, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.

The ECHR awarded the applicant pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages for the violations found.";/;/;Global health and Human Rights Database 
3;law case;"

The applicant is an inmate who argued that his living conditions did not meet the health standards set out under article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms after being displaced from the prison’s mental health unit.

The applicant suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and severe visual impairment. He was prescribed medication to combat his schizophrenia that he would take for the rest of his life. The applicant stopped taking his medication and shot and killed his father. He was sentenced to 8 years in jail.

At the Nicosia Central Prisons, the applicant first resided in Block 10, which is used as a mental health unit within the prison. On January 16, 2017 the prison psychiatrist recommended the applicant be moved to Block 4, which is not a mental health unit, after viewing gradual improvement of the applicant’s symptoms.

The applicant first asked for a special computer to follow classes provided by the prison school. The prison responded that the applicant already had access to a special computer program for blind users, as well as audiobooks and CDs. An additional complaint regarding lack of activities was addressed by the prison’s special training and further computer programs. 

The applicant’s medical records also showed that the applicant was regularly assessed by the prison’s psychiatrist who provided remedies for his mental health. To ease the applicant’s noise concerns in block 4, the applicant was granted a CD player and audiobooks. The applicant also complained of being bullied in block 4.

The European Committee for Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment visited the Nicosia Central Prisons in 2017. It found that blocks 4 and 10 had been newly renovated, living conditions had improved, and many mental health-care employees were staffed.";/;"The court held that in order for an ill treatment to come within the scope of section 3, the ill treatment must reach a minimum level of severity. To determine if the case at hand reached that minimum level, the court considered three relevant elements: 1) the medical condition of the prisoner, 2) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention, and 3) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in full in view of the applicant’s health. In this case the court largely focused on the second consideration of whether the medical assistance provided was adequate for observing the applicant’s section 3 rights.

The court found that the evidence had not conclusively established that the applicant was subject to distress or hardship of intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering in detention. The court found that: both block 4 and 10 were newly renovated, the applicant had sufficient space to move around in block 4, the authorities duly responded to the applicant’s requests concerning his living standard issues and difficulties. The authorities responded to the applicant’s requests by: training the applicant in 2017 to move around and live with his disability, granting the applicant audiobooks and CDs, and rectifying the applicant’s bullying problem.

The court also observed that the applicant received adequate medical psychiatric and psychological treatment in both block 4 and 10. The applicant’s medical treatment and staffing did not change when he moved into block 4, the applicant’s treatments were never denied or delayed, and the applicant’s mental state even improved after consulting the prison psychiatrist.";"“The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society, prohibiting in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, in order to come within the scope of Article 3, the ill-treatment must reach a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum is a relative one and depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim…” (Para 50)

“In deciding on the compatibility of an applicant’s health with his stay in detention, the Court considers at least three relevant elements: (a) the medical condition of the prisoner, (b) the adequacy of the medical assistance and care provided in detention, and (c) the advisability of maintaining the detention measure in view of the state of health of an applicant.” (para 51)";/;Global health and Human Rights Database 
4;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a midwife is supervising a normal pregnancy and childbirth, and an emergency arises where it is too late to call for medical assistance, how should the midwife act in terms of performing medical interventions?;"A midwife is supervising a home birth for a woman who has chosen a natural delivery. The pregnancy has been normal, and there are no expected complications. As the delivery progresses, the midwife realizes that the baby is in distress and the situation escalates to an emergency. The midwife knows that immediate action is required to potentially save the baby's life. The quickest option available is a manual abruption of the placenta, which the midwife is qualified to perform, but it carries risks for both the mother and the baby. The midwife also has the option to wait for medical assistance from a specialist, but there is a real possibility that help may not arrive in time.

The midwife is faced with an ethical decision: proceed with the emergency procedure, which could result in immediate resolution of the distress but with inherent risks, or wait for a specialist and risk the possibility of a negative outcome due to the delay.

Should the midwife take immediate action to perform the manual abruption, following their training and the authority granted by the Midwives Act, even though it involves significant risk? Or should they prioritize the protocol of working under a specialist's instruction, even if that means potentially endangering the baby's life due to the time taken for the specialist to arrive?";"""Supervision of Pregnancy and Childbirth

    According to §2(2) of the Midwives Act, midwives are authorized to independently supervise a normal pregnancy and a so-called normal delivery. In this context midwives are also allowed to administer perinatal specific pain mitigating or anticonvulsant drugs and to take blood samples from the newborn by pricking one of the baby’s heels. If no medical specialist is present and it is too late to call for medical assistance in case of emergency, the midwife may legally perform all necessary medical interventions such as a manual abruption of the placenta after delivery (§2[2] No. 7). Nevertheless, midwives are obliged to call for medical assistance if complications are expected, or arise during pregnancy or childbirth. If a specialist in gynaecology is present, the midwife shall only act on instruction of and in collaboration with the medical specialist (§4).""";/;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
5;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a physician is faced with the decision to perform genital mutilation, how should they act in good conscience, especially considering the potential for long-lasting effects on a patient's sexual sensibility?;"Imagine a physician who specializes in gender affirmation surgery, which often includes genital reconstruction. One day, a patient approaches the physician with a request for surgery to alter their genitalia to align with their gender identity. The patient has been living with gender dysphoria and, after years of counseling and consideration, believes that this surgery is crucial for their well-being and mental health. However, the physician is aware that such procedures are a subject of ethical debate among medical professionals, and some consider them to be a form of genital mutilation.

The physician is confronted with a decision that raises ethical questions about patient autonomy, informed consent, and the physician's role in providing care that might be viewed by some as controversial. They must consider the potential for improving the patient's quality of life against the possibility that other healthcare professionals may view the surgery as ethically problematic.

The physician deeply believes in the principle of ""do no harm"" and is committed to aiding their patients in living healthier and more fulfilling lives. However, they are also aware that performing a procedure classified by some as genital mutilation—even with the patient's eager consent and perceived medical necessity—could be seen as ethically questionable by their peers.

Should the physician proceed with the surgery, respecting the patient's informed consent and desire for a life that reflects their true gender identity, while bearing in mind the ethical concerns surrounding such medical interventions?";"§3. ILLEGAL MEDICAL ACTIVITIES

    Certain medical activities such as abortion, sterilization, reproductive medicine (in vitro fertilization, insemination), prenatal or genetic diagnostics, organ transplantations and (clinical) research on human beings may only be carried out if certain legal conditions are fulfilled. Otherwise, physicians as well as all other illegally practising therapists shall be prosecuted by criminal or administrative law, depending on the medical activity in question.

It may be pointed out that only certain medical activities are prohibited by the Criminal Code, namely abortion, sterilization, genital mutilation and active euthanasia. Abortion and sterilization are only legal under the conditions stipulated in §97 and §90(2) of the Criminal Code. Genital mutilations that have a lasting negative effect on the sexual sensibility are prohibited by §90(3). If somebody intentionally carries out a forbidden genital mutilation, he is liable for the offence of intentional bodily injury with strong lasting effect (§85). Even so, genital mutilations are legal if they are performed by physicians and do not have a lasting effect on the sexual sensibility. Moreover, the opinion is held that genital mutilations may be legal medical interventions if there is a medical indication, for example in case of transsexual interventions. Active euthanasia is generally an illegal medical activity according to the Criminal Code. Thus, both the assistance in committing suicide and voluntary euthanasia are prohibited by §78 or §77 (for details see Part II, Chapter 3 below).""";/;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
6;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a medical professional is preparing to perform a procedure that will affect a patient's physical integrity, how should the professional proceed ethically to ensure that the patient's right to self-determination is respected?;"A patient with a non-life-threatening but painful chronic condition is offered a new experimental treatment that promises significant relief from symptoms. The treatment, however, is still in the trial phase and its long-term effects are not fully known. The patient, desperate for relief, is eager to proceed but does not fully understand the potential risks and the experimental nature of the treatment. The physician, aware of the patient's limited understanding, must decide whether to administer the treatment.

The physician is ethically conflicted because, while the treatment could provide the much-needed relief, the patient's consent may not be fully informed due to a lack of comprehension of the risks involved. Furthermore, the physician knows that the right to self-determination is a fundamental one, protected by law, and it mandates that consent for medical treatments must be based on a clear understanding of all the implications.";"§3. RIGHTS AND DUTIES RELATING TO THE PATIENT'S SELF-DETERMINATION

    In accordance with Article 8 of the ECHR, the right to respect for private or family life, which has the quality of constitutional law in Austria, everybody has the fundamental right to self-determination regarding his individual physical integrity. In fulfilment of the constitutional duty to grant patients the exercise of this right, the legislator has established the provisions of §110 of the Criminal Code and of §8(3) of the Frame Law on Hospitals and Sanatoria. Both provisions state that every medical treatment principally needs the patient's consent in advance. Thus, every medical intervention that affects the patient's physical integrity is generally an illegal act. Furthermore, it is considered as an illicit infliction of a bodily injury unless it is justified, in particular by the patient’s or his legal representative's valid consent.

    It may be pointed out that the patient's acceptance of the contract must not be mixed up with the patient's informed consent to the medical treatment (see Part 1, Chapter 4, §1.11.A. above).

    It is generally accepted that a valid consent requires the patient’s capacity to consent, appropriate information, absence of any legal obstacles to consent, and a valid declaration of will. The patient's consent should be based on a free and well-considered declaration (§869 in conjunction with §876 Civil Code) and should not be initiated by error, fraud, deception or by physical or mental pressure (§870 Civil Code).";/;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
7;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a physician treats a patient who, due to a health condition, could pose a serious risk to public safety (for instance, in the case of an ambulance driver with alcohol addiction, who drives under influence, or an HIV-positive patient refusing to inform a partner about the infection) how should the physician ethically balance the duty of confidentiality with the need to prevent harm to others?;;On equal terms with higher public health care interests, the Supreme Court ruled that under certain circumstances, a disclosure of secrets to public authorities by the attending physicians could be legitimate. In the case at issue, the attending physicians treated a man in hospital because of alcohol abuse. In the course of treatment they had learned that the man was working as an ambulance driver and had already committed several crimes under the influence of alcohol. The physicians informed the public authorities after they had unsuccessfully tried to convince him to undergo a treatment. Subsequently, the public authorities revoked the man’s driving license. Due to the extraordinary circumstances of the case the Supreme Court decided that the physicians had not breached their confidentiality, since this had served the higher public interests to safeguard the life and health of other traffic. Some legal authors argued that the same principle shall apply in the case where an HIV-positive patient refuses to inform the sex partner about the infection although repeatedly being informed about the risk of transmission to the sex partner and possible consequences in criminal law (§178, 179 Criminal Code). In the case in which both sex partners are patients of the attending physician, it is generally accepted that the physician is, in the face of the HIV-positive patient's refusal, not only allowed to tell the other sex partner about the infection, but also has the (contractual) duty to inform the patient in order to safeguard the patient's health (in accordance with §49[1] of the Physicians Act which stipulates that the physician is also obliged to safeguard the health of his healthy patients).;;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
8;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a medical practitioner is accused of not adhering to the standard of care and documentation is insufficient or lacking, how should they ethically manage their responsibility to demonstrate that they have acted competently and in accordance with medical standards? Is the burden of proof on the practioner or on the patient?;/;"    Fault is the main basis for a claim for medical error either ex contractu or ex delicto. Any deviation from the professional standard is considered as fault (§1299 Civil Code). In principle, the claiming patient has the burden to prove that the physician has neglected his duty to carry out the treatment according to the professional standard or as a prudent and diligent standard physician in the same circumstances.

If medical practitioners or doctors-in-training practice beyond their medical field of expertise, the patient's burden of proof is alleviated (Übernahmeverschulden). The patient only has to prove that the protective law according to §151 Civil Code has been infringed (e.g., §131 or §131[3] Physicians Act). As a result, the defendant has to prove his competence, that other prudent and diligent standard medical practitioners would not have acted differently and that the damage would have occurred in any way.

Due to the difficulty to prove medical malpractice, the Supreme Court judges in constant jurisdiction that the burden of proof shall be alleviated in favour of the patient. If a physician fails to comply with his duty to record the treatment and thereby makes it more difficult for the patient to prove the medical malpractice, such proof is facilitated corresponding to the difficulties caused by the missing documentation in order to ensure a fair distribution of evidentiary positions between the physician and the patient. If there is a lack of documentation so that proof of the medical malpractice is not possible at all, the Supreme Court goes even farther and reverses the burden of proof so that the physician has to prove that the medical treatment was carried out lege artis. However, in cases in which it is certain that the patient was informed properly and treated according to the lex artis, the question of burden of proof is not decisive.""";/;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
9;regulation & gpt genrated question;In the case where a medical procedure is conducted without the explicit consent of the patient, how should a healthcare provider ethically assess the situation and determine the right course of action, particularly when the procedure is non-urgent and the patient's immediate health is not at risk?;/;"IV. Criminal Liability

    Every medical treatment is qualified as an unlawful infliction of bodily harm, unless it is justified by the patient's valid (informed) consent. Concerning the legal consequences, the Criminal Code differentiates between curative treatments and treatments without medical indication.

    A curative treatment, which the patient has not consented to, violates §110(1) Criminal Code. §110(1) states that anyone who treats another person without the person’s consent, even if carried out according to the current state of medical science and knowledge, can be sentenced to prison up to six months or may be fined. Only in case of imminent severe danger to the patient’s health or life, or if the physician is unaware that the situation did not demand an urgent treatment at the time he carried out the medical treatment without prior consent, the acting physician is deemed unintentional and therefore shall not be prosecuted (§110(2)). A violation of §110(1) may only be prosecuted upon request of the victim itself.

If the physician or another non-medical health care provider acts with negligence in the course of the curative treatment, he may (additionally) be prosecuted for causing negligent bodily harm according to §88 et seq. of the Criminal Code or for causing negligent death according to §80 et seq. of the Criminal Code. However, health care providers shall not be prosecuted for causing negligent bodily harm if the physical assault or damage is not caused by gross negligence in the course of curative treatment (§82[1] No. 3 Criminal Code, as last amended by Federal Law Gazette 1 2015/154).

    In cases in which the medical treatment is carried out without a medical indication, as for example plastic surgery, sterilization or organ removal, the invasive intervention is qualified as an offence of physical injury according to §83 et seq. of the Criminal Code. However, in these cases the caused bodily harm can be justified with the informed consent of the patient and therefore can be carried out lawfully unless the act violates public policy (e.g., genital mutilations are forbidden under certain circumstances according to §90[3] of the Criminal Code; abortion and sterilization are only allowed under certain conditions according to §97 or §90[2] of the Criminal Code in conjunction with §163 of the Civil Code and others).";/;/;Medical Law in Austria (ISBN:  9789041195340, 9789041195357, 9789041195364, 9041195343, 9041195351, 904119536)
