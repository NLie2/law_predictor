    "question": "Choose one best answer among five options. Provide reasoning for your decision. Q.1: A nursing instructor is teaching nursing students about principles of ethics in health care, and she tells them that the utmost important principle to observe while taking care of patient is doing no harm. The principle of Ethics she described here: a) Beneficence b) Justice c) Nonmaleficence d) Respect for autonomy e) Veracity ",
    "gold_answer": " Answer key for question 1 is: (C) Level of learners: Graduate students Level of Cognition: C1 Rationale for answer: principles of ethics involve respect for autonomy, Nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice together with values and virtues of individual, families, and communities. Doing no harm is Nonmaleficence that comes; from Hippocratic Oath to Nightingale Pledge is integral part of code of ethics for all health professionals (American Nurses' Association, 1985; Beauchamp & Childress, 2001)",
    "model_answer": "The correct answer is: c) Nonmaleficence Reasoning: The principle described by the nursing instructor, emphasizing the importance of not causing harm to the patient, aligns with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence. Nonmaleficence is the obligation to do no harm and to prevent or minimize harm when possible. While beneficence (option a) also plays a role in promoting the well-being of the patient, the instructor's emphasis on avoiding harm specifically points to nonmaleficence as the primary ethical principle in this context."

    "question": " Choose one best answer among five options. Provide reasoning for your decision. A 25 years old healthy male dies in a fatal road traffic accident; he has advance directives about his organ donations. Health care rationing of organs take multiple factors into account for deciding of who will be recipient of organ. Social utility, equity, equality, distributive justice, beneficence and expected life expectancy after organ transplantation ,all perspectives play roles in allocating of scarce organs to recipients, as waiting lists are lengthy and decision is tough. The most likely recipient of organ will be: a)    A 45 years alcoholic with irreversible liver failure. b)    A 75 years old female with extreme form of dementia and end stage renal failure. c)    A 35 years young entrepreneur with acute renal failure. d)    A 10 years old male with multi organ failure and brain death. e)    A 40 years old female with heart failure and HIV positive. ",
    "gold_answer": "Answer key for question 4 is: (C) Level of learners: Graduate students Level of Cognition: C2 Rationale for answer: rationing of donated Organs is a difficult decision and everybody who is on waiting list, in his/her own right is the most deserving candidate for that organ, when the organs are scarce and recipients are more, then queuing and lottery could be one option to make a decision on bases of chance and not on choice, it will be to some extent fair as no one can claim decision is bias that came out of lottery as it is merely on pure chance, and randomization whose name is picked. But many other factors like life expectancy after organ transplantation and utilitarian view of how much that recipient do greatest good to society. Quality of life and social services by the recipients after organ transplantation, and social support system of recipient all play role in deciding who is the perfect candidate as organ recipient (Beauchamp & Childress, 2001; Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 2013; Truog, 2005).",
    "model_answer": "The most likely recipient of the organ, considering various factors like expected life expectancy after transplantation and potential benefits, would be: c) A 35 years young entrepreneur with acute renal failure. Reasoning: Organ allocation often considers factors such as expected life expectancy after transplantation, the severity of the recipient's condition, and the potential for the organ to provide significant benefits. A younger recipient with acute renal failure, like the 35 years old entrepreneur, may have a higher likelihood of a successful transplant and a longer post-transplant life expectancy compared to recipients with irreversible liver failure, extreme dementia, or multi-organ failure. While the other individuals have significant health issues, the potential for successful transplantation and improved quality of life may be higher for the younger individual with acute renal fail "

    "question": "In the following you will receive details of a court case. The applicants appeal is described in detail.  'This is a case about the applicant challenging an order from Mental Health Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) that demanded her involuntary admission to St. John of God’s Hospital (“the Hospital”) for treatment of a mental disorder. On April 28th, 2014, a member of An Garda Síochána detained the applicant because there were sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder which would cause harm to herself and others. The member requested a registered medical practitioner’s opinion on whether the applicant should be involuntarily admitted to a hospital for treatment of mental disorder, as required by s. 12 of the Mental Health Act 2001 ('the 2001 Act'),. After examination, the medical practitioner recommended the applicant being admitted and treated by the Elm Mount Unit of St. Vincent’s University Hospital in Elm Park, Dublin 4. The applicant was examined again by a consultant psychiatrist in this hospital before her admission, who described the applicant as 'thin, unkempt, thought disorder, persecutory delusions, erratic unpredictable behavior, and non compliance with medications” and from which the psychiatrist suggested “the reception, detention and treatment of the applicant” based on Section 3 of the 2001 Act. The clinical director of the Elm Mount Unit transferred the applicant to the hospital because “the applicant would be under the care of her previous consultant psychiatrist, and in a secure setting, there.' The tribunal reviewed this detention shortly after the hearing on May 15th, 2014, and affirmed the admission order on April 27th 2014 because it was satisfied that the applicant suffered a mental disorder as defined in Section 3 of the 2001 Act. The consultant responsible for the treatment of the applicant renewed and extended the applicant’s detention on May 16th 2014. On June 5th 2014, another tribunal reviewed the detention on the ground of renewal order and upheld it. The applicant sought for judicial review of the second tribunal decision because she claimed both the detention and the renewed order were illegal. The relevant provisions are as stated below: Section 3 of the 2001 Act states: 'In this Act “mental disorder” means mental illness, severe dementia or significant intellectual disability where- (a) because of the illness, disability or dementia, there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or other persons, or (b) (i) because of the severity of the illness, disability or dementia, the judgment of the person concerned is so impaired that failure to admit the person to an approved centre would be likely to lead to a serious deterioration in his or her condition or would prevent the administration of appropriate treatment that could be given only by such admission and, and' (ii) the reception, detention and treatment of the person concerned would be likely to benefit or alleviate the condition of that person to a material extent.' Section 17 of the 2001 Act has the following options for a Tribunal reviewing the detention of a person subject to an admission or renewal order: “ (a) if satisfied that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder and (i) that the provisions of sections 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 16, where applicable, have been complied with, or (ii) if there has been a failure to comply with any such provision, that the failure does not affect the substance of the order and does not cause an injustice, affirm the order, or (b) if not so satisfied, revoke the order and direct that the patient be discharged from the approved centre concerned.' Answer to each of the appeals from the perspective of the court. Do not break character at any point. Come to a decision whether the appeal should be granted or whether the appeal should be dismissed.",
    "gold_answer": " The Court held that the detention and the renewed order were valid both in substance and in form. First, the tribunal is entitled to have an independent conclusion and may only give a general description of the reasoning. Second, unlike alleged by the applicant, the Court found that the tribunal’s review process did follow the criterion set out by s. 3(1)(b) of the Act. The Court noted that the Tribunal’s findings that the severity of the illness impaired the applicant’s judgment, that failure to detain the applicant would result in a deterioration in her condition or would prevent the administration of appropriate treatment, that detention would likely alleviate her condition, were consistent with the evidence.",
    "model_answer": "The court, after careful consideration of the presented details, must address the applicant's appeal challenging the involuntary admission order from the Mental Health Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). The applicant contests the legality of both the initial detention and the subsequent renewal order. The relevant provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, particularly Section 3, define 'mental disorder' and provide conditions under which involuntary admission is warranted. The court acknowledges the serious nature of the criteria outlined in Section 3, requiring a likelihood of immediate and serious harm to the individual or others, impaired judgment, and the potential benefit or alleviation through reception, detention, and treatment. Furthermore, Section 17 of the 2001 Act outlines the options available to the Tribunal when reviewing the detention, allowing affirmation or revocation based on compliance with specific sections or considerations of substantial impact. In reviewing the case, the court finds that the Tribunal's decision to affirm the admission order on April 27th, 2014, and subsequent renewals on May 16th, 2014, and June 5th, 2014, were in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health Act. The court notes the serious nature of the applicant's condition as described by the consultant psychiatrist, including thought disorder, persecutory delusions, erratic behavior, and non-compliance with medications. Considering the information provided and the legal framework, the court dismisses the appeal. The Tribunal's decisions appear to align with the criteria specified in the relevant sections of the 2001 Act, and there is no evident failure to comply with these provisions that would affect the substance of the orders or cause an injustice. The court recognizes the delicate balance between protecting the individual and safeguarding public safety in cases involving mental disorders as outlined in the legislation."

    "question": "In the following you will see a case that was brought to court. Predict what the court must have decided. Think step by step. 'The 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs are husband and the wife. The 2nd plaintiff delivered two babies in the defendant hospital’s general ward but was discharged with only one baby. The defendants state that one of the babies was stillborn. The 2nd and the 3rd plaintiffs filed a police report for the loss their baby and thereafter were handed over a body of a dead baby by the mortuary at the hospital. The 2nd and 3rd plaintiff did not believe that it was the body of their baby and further DNA examination showed no biological connection between the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs and the body that was given to them. The plaintiffs therefore filed this suit for the unlawful disappearance of their baby. The issues framed were whether the acts of the defendants has violated the rights of the missing child under Article 34(1) of the Constitution (right to know and be cared by his/her parents); whether the acts of the defendants violated the right to access health information and right to health under Article 41(1), 8A and 45 of the Constitution; whether the acts of the defendants violated the plaintiffs’ right to family life; whether the plaintiffs were subjected to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment and psychological torture in violation of Article 24 and 44(a) of the Constitution.'  Write the text from the perspective of the court and do not break character. You must state a definite decision from the court.",
    "gold_answer": "The Court found that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs’ right to access information under Article 4(1) of the Constitution and further the plaintiffs were inflicted with psychological torture, which is a violation of Article 24 and 44 of the Constitution, Article 7 of the ICCPR and Article 5 of the African Charter. The Court stated that the fact that the hospital staff did not first inform about the second baby being born dead and thereafter handed them the body of a baby, which was not theirs points to the fact of systemic problem of handling dead bodies in the medical facilities in Uganda. The Court further stated that the plaintiffs did not get a change to see their baby and to carry on the last rites for their dead baby" ,
    "model_answer": "The court, after careful consideration of the presented facts and legal arguments, has reached a decision in the matter at hand. Firstly, the court acknowledges the severe emotional distress and anguish experienced by the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs due to the loss of their child. The disappearance of a newborn is an undoubtedly tragic circumstance, and the court extends its deepest sympathies to the grieving parents. The court has diligently examined the issues framed in this case. With regard to the alleged violation of the missing child's rights under Article 34(1) of the Constitution, the court finds that the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the baby, the lack of a biological connection to the provided body, and the emotional trauma inflicted upon the parents indeed constitute a violation of the right to know and be cared for by one's parents. Moving on to the violation of the right to access health information and right to health under Article 41(1), 8A, and 45 of the Constitution, the court notes the distressing nature of the events that transpired within the defendant hospital. The failure to provide accurate information regarding the fate of the child and the ensuing psychological trauma suffered by the parents are clear infringements on their rights to access health information and health itself. Concerning the alleged violation of the plaintiffs' right to family life, the court recognizes that the disappearance of their child has significantly impacted the family dynamics and emotional well-being of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs. This constitutes a breach of their right to family life. Lastly, the court considers the claim of the plaintiffs being subjected to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment, and psychological torture in violation of Article 24 and 44(a) of the Constitution. The court finds that the events surrounding the loss of their child, the conflicting information provided, and the emotional toll endured by the plaintiffs do indeed amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, as well as psychological torture. In light of these considerations, the court unequivocally declares that the acts of the defendants have violated multiple constitutional rights of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs. The court orders the defendants to provide a comprehensive and truthful account of the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the child and to take appropriate remedial actions to address the emotional and psychological harm inflicted upon the plaintiffs. Additionally, the court may recommend further legal actions to be taken, including potential compensation for the damages suffered by the plaintiffs. This decision is final, and the court emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional rights and ensuring accountability in matters of such gravity."
